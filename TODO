TODO

-- Make a variety of n-gram processing functions to output in
   several different formats (e.g., list of strings, tuple)

-- Implement some sort of parser to count n-grams in files

-- implement lexeme frequency counter [Testing]
   -- The problem with this function is that it may count "".
      This will need to be corrected in the construction of
      lists
   
   -- countWord, getWordsFreqs, lexemeCountProfile are all
      related to this goal
      

-- implement n-gram frequency counter [Testing]

-- implement quickCheck tests

-- implement data types like Corpus,  Document, Paragraph, Sentence, Word
