Versioning Information
------------------------
This is the history of the previous versions and what new features were
implemented for each release. Things were getting a bit long in the README.md,
so the old changelogs will get put in here.

### Version 0.2.5
 - Return of multi-paragraph Parsing

### Version 0.2.4

Major, breaking API changes have been implemented!

 - All code has been refactored to use Data.Text as the basic
   type of text representation. This includes processing functions,
   parsers, and IO. However, older versions of String processing
   functions are still included in the source but are not actually
   called.

 - The CLI is currently only processing single paragraphs at a time
   because of the difficulties associated with multiple possible
   paragraph separators. Addressing this likely requires some way to
   try parsers without consuming input.

 - Rudimentary metadata parsing funcitonality

 - Expanded type system for metadata descriptions

### Version 0.2.3
New features:
 - Cabal-based build system for installation in a cabal sandbox. 

 - Skeleton testing facilities. Only one test is implemented, so
   this is very barebones.

 - More complete directory structure, along with specific example
   texts that work with the binary.

 - The commandline options have been exapanded to take bigram and
   trigram extraction specifications

 - NGramCrackers.StringOps module introduced to hold operations that
   take Strings as the base processing unit. Since parsing involves
   putting elements into lists, it seemed most effective to transition
   towards a more list based set of operations. 

   This module contains some string operations that need to be
   used in the processing stage so as not to entirely break
   the build, but they will likely be phased out at some point.

### Version 0.2.2
 - Changes to backend profiling functions now reflect their general
   nature: Such functions will also profile larger ngrams than just
   words.

### Version 0.2.1
 - Limited multiparagraph parsing is now available in NGramCrackers!

### Version 0.2.0 
 - Rudimentary profiling and extraction capabilities.
     
  NGramCrackers can now print a profile of a single paragraph input file
  to a specified output file. The statistics provided are a word count
  or a type-token-ratio report.

  These very basic capabilities provide a very useful skeleton for adding
  more functionality, such as ngram extraction, and more statistics, such
  as mean words per sentence, mean words per paragraph, mean sentences per
  paragraph, etc.

### Version 0.1.1
 - Modualised argument handling system for ease of future development. 
   Future modifications to argument handling can take place in a contained
   environment and can be reused in other applications

### Version 0.1.0 -- Release Date: 04.01.2015

Primary features:

 - First public alpha release. The CL tool and the backend library will be
    changing a great deal.

 - Very basic commandline argument parsing that enables the 
   specification of input and output files.

 - Basic word count properties and type-token ratio functionality

 - Separation of version, help, summary, etc. from myArgs, the argument
   record for the programme. getOpts is an abstraction to handle the use of
   cmdArgs before being passed into the optionHandler
