To install NGramCrackers, I suggest using a cabal sandbox.

$ cabal sandbox init

$ cabal install -j

The binaries are in the .cabal-sandbox file and can be run with the usuali
options.

The deprecated command for compiling is a very short ghc call:

$ ghc -Wall -O2 -o GramCrackers Main.hs

I use the -O2 flag, but -O will also work for optimising the compiled code.

There is also a compile shell script that runs this.
