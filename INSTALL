To install NGramCrackers, I suggest using a cabal sandbox.

$ cabal sandbox init

$ cabal install -j

The binaries are in the .cabal-sandbox file and can be run with the usual
options.

Shell Scripts
#############
There are now shell scripts to compile ngc, with or without profiling options
enabled on the binary. Another script, parseCrackers.sh, is for running my
current common test commands. These scripts must be sourced to use the functions
within them.

The sourcing could be done automatically during the compilation. I don't think
this is the best default behaviour, though, to be sourcing random shell scripts.

Current
#############
$ ghc -Wall -O2 -o ngc Main.hs -prof -v

##########
Deprecated
###########
The deprecated command for compiling is a very short ghc call:

$ ghc -Wall -O2 -o GramCrackers Main.hs

I use the -O2 flag, but -O will also work for optimising the compiled code.
