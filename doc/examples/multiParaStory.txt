A goose flew over the buildling
thinking about parallelism in Haskell. It was a bit strange because most other
geese liked to talk about bugs. The coding goose liked bugs too, but she also
liked other curried functions. <para> The quick brown foxes jumped over a single
wooden fence over by the river. The farmer was a sad panda about the chickens
who had run away and hopped on over the bridge. The chickens pecked at the
ground by the river, eating seeds and, if very lucky, some tasty bugs. The foxes
were vegetarians, so they ran off. A a flock of geese flew in and landed by the
river across from the chickens. The geese wandered around eating grass. <para> 
Cockatiels like mirror birds. Dandelions are blooming since it's spring but
Oregon lacks armadillos like southeastern texas. Armadillos are like those
giant pill bugs that live in the ocean. <para>
